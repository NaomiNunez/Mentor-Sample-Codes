//Good Example - by using a flag "!Thread.interrupted()" we are able to stop the thread from never exiting.

public class Robot extends IterativeRobot {
    public void robotInit() {
        Thread t = new Thread(() -> {
            while (!Thread.interrupted()) {
					// Not stuck anymore!
            }
        });
        t.start();
    }
}

//Bad Example - code will never exit and will only stop when entire JVM stops. Java cannot stop the thread unless the thread stops itself.

public class Robot extends IterativeRobot {
    public void robotInit() {
        Thread t = new Thread(() -> {
            while (true) {
					// We are stuck here
            }
        });
        t.start();
    }
}
